(1, 1, 1, 'Louvre Museum, Paris 10:46 P.M.\r\nRenowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum\'s Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.\r\nAs he had anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading the entrance to the suite. The parquet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.\r\nThe curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive. He crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide.\r\nA voice spoke, chillingly close. \"Do not move.\"\r\nOn his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.\r\nOnly fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His\r\n irises were pink with dark red pupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the barrel through the bars, directly at the curator. \"You should not have run.\" His accent was not easy to place. \"Now tell me where it is.\"\r\n\"I told you already,\" the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floor of the gallery. \"I have no idea what you are talking about!\"\r\n\"You are lying.\" The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glint in his ghostly eyes. \"You and your brethren possess something that is not yours.\"\r\nThe curator felt a surge of adrenaline. How could he possibly know this?\r\n\"Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live.\" The\r\nman leveled his gun at the curator\'s head. \"Is it a secret you will die for?\" Saunière could not breathe.\r\nThe man tilted his head, peering down the barrel of his gun.\r\nSaunière held up his hands in defense. \"Wait,\" he said slowly. \"I will tell you what you need to know.\" The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many times... each time praying he would never have to use it.\r\nWhen the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. \"Yes. This is exactly what the others told me.\"\r\nSaunière recoiled. The others?\r\n\"I found them, too,\" the huge man taunted. \"All three of them. They confirmed what you have just\r\nsaid.\"\r\nIt cannot be! The curator\'s true identity, along with the identities of his three sénéchaux, was almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected. Saunière now realized his sénéchaux, following strict procedure, had told the same lie before their own deaths. It was part of the protocol.\r\nThe attacker aimed his gun again. \"When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows the truth.\"\r\nThe truth. In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation. If I die, the truth will be lost forever. Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover.\r\nThe gun roared, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bullet lodged in his stomach. He fell\r\n\r\n forward... struggling against the pain. Slowly, Saunière rolled over and stared back through the bars at his attacker.\r\nThe man was now taking dead aim at Saunière\'s head.\r\nSaunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret.\r\nThe click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor.\r\nThe curator\'s eyes flew open.\r\nThe man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip, but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Saunière\'s gut. \"My work here is done.\"\r\nThe curator looked down and saw the bullet hole in his white linen shirt. It was framed by a small circle of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach. Almost cruelly, the bullet had missed his heart. As a veteran of la Guerre d\'Algérie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawn- out death before. For fifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chest cavity, slowly poisoning him from within.\r\n\"Pain is good, monsieur,\" the man said. Then he was gone.\r\nAlone now, Jacques Saunière turned his gaze again to the iron gate. He was trapped, and the doors could not be reopened for at least twenty minutes. By the time anyone got to him, he would be dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was a fear far greater than that of his own death.\r\nI must pass on the secret.\r\nStaggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought of the generations who had come before them... of the mission with which they had all been entrusted.\r\nAn unbroken chain of knowledge.\r\nSuddenly, now, despite all the precautions... despite all the fail-safes... Jacques Saunière was the only remaining link, the sole guardian of one of the most powerful secrets ever kept.\r\nShivering, he pulled himself to his feet.\r\nI must find some way....\r\nHe was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he\r\n\r\ncould pass the torch. Saunière gazed up at the walls of his opulent prison. A collection of the world\'s most famous paintings seemed to smile down on him like old friends.\r\nWincing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperate task before him, he knew, would require every remaining second of his life.\r\n', NULL),
(4, 1, 2, 'Robert Langdon awoke slowly.\r\nA telephone was ringing in the darkness—a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.\r\nWhere the hell am I?\r\nThe jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.\r\nSlowly, the fog began to lift.\r\nLangdon picked up the receiver. \"Hello?\"\r\n\"Monsieur Langdon?\" a man\'s voice said. \"I hope I have not awoken you?\"\r\nDazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the dead.\r\n\"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it is urgent.\"\r\nLangdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.\r\nTHE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\r\nproudly presents\r\nAN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDON PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY\r\nLangdon groaned. Tonight\'s lecture—a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of Chartres Cathedral—had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely,\r\n some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight. \"I\'m sorry,\" Langdon said, \"but I\'m very tired and—\"\r\n\"Mais, monsieur,\" the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. \"Your guest is an important man.\"\r\nLangdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon\'s visibility had increased a hundredfold after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self- important historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.\r\n\"If you would be so kind,\" Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, \"could you take the man\'s name and number, and tell him I\'ll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you.\" He hung up before the concierge could protest.\r\nSitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted: SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him was a stranger—tousled and weary.\r\nYou need a vacation, Robert.\r\nThe past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn\'t appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.\r\nIf Boston Magazine could see me now.\r\nLast month, much to Langdon\'s embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that city\'s top ten most intriguing people—a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt him at the lecture he had given.\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen...\" the hostess had announced to a full house at the American University of Paris\'s Pavilion Dauphine, \"Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you use his textbooks in class.\"\r\nThe students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n \"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However...\" She glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. \"An audience member has just handed me a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction.\"\r\nShe held up a copy of Boston Magazine.\r\nLangdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?\r\nThe hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed no signs of letting up. \"And Mr. Langdon\'s refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last year\'s Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter.\" The hostess goaded the crowd. \"Would you like to hear more?\"\r\nThe crowd applauded.\r\nSomebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.\r\n\"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. His captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female students describe as \'chocolate for the ears.\' \"\r\nThe hall erupted in laughter.\r\nLangdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next—some ridiculous line about \"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\"—and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again to wear his Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.\r\n\"Thank you, Monique,\" Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the podium. \"Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction.\" He turned to the audience with an embarrassed sigh. \"And if I find which one of you provided that article, I\'ll have the consulate deport you.\"\r\nThe crowd laughed.\r\n\"Well, folks, as you all know, I\'m here tonight to talk about the power of symbols...\"\r\nThe ringing of Langdon\'s hotel phone once again broke the silence.\r\n\r\n Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. \"Yes?\"\r\nAs expected, it was the concierge. \"Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am calling to inform you that your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you.\"\r\nLangdon was wide awake now. \"You sent someone to my room?\"\r\n\"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority to stop him.\"\r\n\"Who exactly is he?\"\r\nBut the concierge was gone.\r\nAlmost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon\'s door.\r\nUncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. \"Who is it?\"\r\n\"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you.\" The man\'s English was accented—a sharp, authoritative bark. \"My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire.\"\r\nLangdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U.S. FBI.\r\nLeaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back at him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking blue uniform.\r\n\"May I come in?\" the agent asked.\r\nLangdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger\'s sallow eyes studied him. \"What is this all about?\"\r\n\"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter.\"\r\n\"Now?\" Langdon managed. \"It\'s after midnight.\"\r\n\"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?\"\r\nLangdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Saunière had been slated to meet for drinks after Langdon\'s lecture tonight, but Saunière had never shown up. \"Yes. How did you know that?\"\r\n\"We found your name in his daily planner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust nothing is wrong?\"\r\nThe agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.\r\nWhen Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.\r\n\"This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre.\"\r\nAs Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden upwelling of anger. \"Who would do this!\"\r\n\"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in symbology and your plans to meet with him.\"\r\nLangdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image was gruesome and profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of déjà vu. A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.\r\nThe agent checked his watch. \"My capitaine is waiting, sir.\"\r\nLangdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. \"This symbol here, and the\r\nway his body is so oddly...\"\r\n\"Positioned?\" the agent offered.\r\nLangdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. \"I can\'t imagine who would do this to someone.\"\r\nThe agent looked grim. \"You don\'t understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph...\" He paused. \"Monsieur Saunière did that to himself.\"\r\n', NULL),
(5, 1, 3, '\r\nOne mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyère. The spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the Lord.\r\nPain is good.\r\n His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly, not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were forbidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him.\r\nThe room was spartan—hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar sanctuary in New York City.\r\nThe Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.\r\nTonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.\r\n\"Yes?\" a male voice answered.\r\n\"Teacher, I have returned.\"\r\n\"Speak,\" the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.\r\n\"All four are gone. The three sénéchaux... and the Grand Master himself.\"\r\nThere was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. \"Then I assume you have the information?\"\r\n\"All four concurred. Independently.\"\r\n\"And you believed them?\"\r\n\"Their agreement was too great for coincidence.\"\r\nAn excited breath. \"Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood\'s reputation for secrecy might prevail.\"\r\n\"The prospect of death is strong motivation.\"\r\n\"So, my pupil, tell me what I must know.\"\r\nSilas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. \"Teacher, all four confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte... the legendary keystone.\"\r\nHe heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher\'s excitement. \"The keystone. Exactly as we suspected.\"\r\nAccording to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone—a clef de voûte... or keystone—an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood\'s greatest secret...\r\n\r\n information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood\'s very existence. \"When we possess the keystone,\" the Teacher said, \"we will be only one step away.\"\r\n\"We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris.\"\r\n\"Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy.\"\r\nSilas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death, had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. Each had told Silas the exact same thing—that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of Paris\'s ancient churches—the Eglise de Saint-Sulpice.\r\n\"Inside a house of the Lord,\" the Teacher exclaimed. \"How they mock us!\" \"As they have for centuries.\"\r\nThe Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. Finally, he spoke. \"You have done a great service to God. We have waited centuries for this. You must retrieve the stone for me. Immediately. Tonight. You understand the stakes.\"\r\nSilas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was now commanding seemed impossible. \"But the church, it is a fortress. Especially at night. How will I enter?\"\r\nWith the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the Teacher explained what was to be done.\r\nWhen Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.\r\nOne hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soul of today\'s sins. The sins committed today had been holy in purpose. Acts of war against the enemies of God had been committed for centuries. Forgiveness was assured.\r\nEven so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.\r\nPulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. Looking down, he examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. All true followers of The Way wore this device—a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual reminder of Christ\'s suffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of the flesh.\r\n\r\nAlthough Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew today was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the barbs dug deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.\r\nPain is good, Silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of Father Josemaría Escrivá—the Teacher of all Teachers. Although Escrivá had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still whispered by thousands of faithful servants around the globe as they knelt on the floor and performed the sacred practice known as \"corporal mortification.\"\r\nSilas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on the floor beside him. The Discipline. The knots were caked with dried blood. Eager for the purifying effects of his own agony, Silas said a quick prayer. Then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. He whipped it over his shoulder again, slashing at his flesh. Again and again, he lashed.\r\nCastigo corpus meum.\r\nFinally, he felt the blood begin to flow.', NULL),
(6, 1, 4, 'The crisp April air whipped through the open window of the Citroën ZX as it skimmed south past the Opera House and crossed Place Vendôme. In the passenger seat, Robert Langdon felt the city tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. His quick shower and shave had left him looking reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. The frightening image of the curator\'s body remained locked in his mind.\r\nJacques Saunière is dead.\r\nLangdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator\'s death. Despite Saunière\'s reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to revere. His books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of Poussin and Teniers were some of Langdon\'s favorite classroom texts. Tonight\'s meeting had been one Langdon was very much looking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.\r\nAgain the image of the curator\'s body flashed in his mind. Jacques Saunière did that to himself? Langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.\r\nOutside, the city was just now winding down—street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes, waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a\r\n breeze scented with jasmine blossom. The Citroën navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.\r\n\"Le capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in Paris tonight,\" the agent said, speaking for the first time since they\'d left the hotel. \"A fortunate coincidence.\"\r\nLangdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he did not entirely trust. As someone who had spent his life exploring the hidden interconnectivity of disparate emblems and ideologies, Langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories and events. The connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at Harvard, but they are always there, buried just beneath the surface.\r\n\"I assume,\" Langdon said, \"that the American University of Paris told you where I was staying?\"\r\nThe driver shook his head. \"Interpol.\"\r\nInterpol, Langdon thought. Of course. He had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous request of all European hotels to see a passport at check-in was more than a quaint formality—it was the law. On any given night, all across Europe, Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping where. Finding Langdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.\r\nAs the Citroën accelerated southward across the city, the illuminated profile of the Eiffel Tower appeared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. Seeing it, Langdon thought of Vittoria, recalling their playful promise a year ago that every six months they would meet again at a different romantic spot on the globe. The Eiffel Tower, Langdon suspected, would have made their list. Sadly, he last kissed Vittoria in a noisy airport in Rome more than a year ago.\r\n\"Did you mount her?\" the agent asked, looking over.\r\nLangdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. \"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\"She is lovely, no?\" The agent motioned through the windshield toward the Eiffel Tower. \"Have you mounted her?\"\r\nLangdon rolled his eyes. \"No, I haven\'t climbed the tower.\" \"She is the symbol of France. I think she is perfect.\"\r\nLangdon nodded absently. Symbologists often remarked that France—a country renowned for machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure leaders like Napoleon and Pepin the Short—could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than a thousand-foot phallus.\r\nWhen they reached the intersection at Rue de Rivoli, the traffic light was red, but the Citroën didn\'t\r\n\r\n slow. The agent gunned the sedan across the junction and sped onto a wooded section of Rue Castiglione, which served as the northern entrance to the famed Tuileries Gardens—Paris\'s own version of Central Park. Most tourists mistranslated Jardins des Tuileries as relating to the thousands of tulips that bloomed here, but Tuileries was actually a literal reference to something far less romantic. This park had once been an enormous, polluted excavation pit from which Parisian contractors mined clay to manufacture the city\'s famous red roofing tiles—or tuiles.\r\nAs they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turned off the blaring siren. Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. Outside the car, the pale wash of halogen headlights skimmed over the crushed gravel parkway, the rugged whir of the tires intoning a hypnotic rhythm. Langdon had always considered the Tuileries to be sacred ground. These were the gardens in which Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the Impressionist movement. Tonight, however, this place held a strange aura of foreboding.\r\nThe Citroën swerved left now, angling west down the park\'s central boulevard. Curling around a circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out into a wide quadrangle beyond. Langdon could now see the end of the Tuileries Gardens, marked by a giant stone archway.\r\nArc du Carrousel.\r\nDespite the orgiastic rituals once held at the Arc du Carrousel, art aficionados revered this place for another reason entirely. From the esplanade at the end of the Tuileries, four of the finest art museums in the world could be seen... one at each point of the compass.\r\nOut the right-hand window, south across the Seine and Quai Voltaire, Langdon could see the dramatically lit facade of the old train station—now the esteemed Musée d\'Orsay. Glancing left, he could make out the top of the ultramodern Pompidou Center, which housed the Museum of Modern Art. Behind him to the west, Langdon knew the ancient obelisk of Ramses rose above the trees, marking the Musée du Jeu de Paume.\r\nBut it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that Langdon could now see the monolithic Renaissance palace that had become the most famous art museum in the world.\r\nMusée du Louvre.\r\nLangdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt to absorb the entire mass of the edifice. Across a staggeringly expansive plaza, the imposing facade of the Louvre rose like a citadel against the Paris sky. Shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the Louvre was the longest building in Europe, stretching farther than three Eiffel Towers laid end to end. Not even the million square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could challenge the majesty of the facade\'s breadth. Langdon had once walked the Louvre\'s entire perimeter, an astonishing three-mile journey.\r\n\r\n Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience Langdon referred to as \"Louvre Lite\"—a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. Art Buchwald had once boasted he\'d seen all three masterpieces in five minutes and fifty-six seconds.\r\nThe driver pulled out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire French. \"Monsieur Langdon est arrivé. Deux minutes.\"\r\nAn indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.\r\nThe agent stowed the device, turning now to Langdon. \"You will meet the capitaine at the main entrance.\"\r\nThe driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved the engine, and gunned the Citroën up over the curb. The Louvre\'s main entrance was visible now, rising boldly in the distance, encircled by seven triangular pools from which spouted illuminated fountains.\r\nLa Pyramide.\r\nThe new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself. The controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by Chinese-born American architect I. M. Pei\r\nstill evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance\r\ncourtyard. Goethe had described architecture as frozen music, and Pei\'s critics described this pyramid as fingernails on a chalkboard. Progressive admirers, though, hailed Pei\'s seventy-one-foot- tall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method—a\r\nsymbolic link between the old and new—helping usher the Louvre into the next millennium. \"Do you like our pyramid?\" the agent asked.\r\nLangdon frowned. The French, it seemed, loved to ask Americans this. It was a loaded question, of course. Admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tasteless American, and expressing dislike was an insult to the French.\r\n\"Mitterrand was a bold man,\" Langdon replied, splitting the difference. The late French president who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a \"Pharaoh complex.\" Singlehandedly responsible for filling Paris with Egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts.\r\nFrançois Mitterrand had an affinity for Egyptian culture that was so all-consuming that the French still referred to him as the Sphinx.\r\n\"What is the captain\'s name?\" Langdon asked, changing topics.\r\n\r\n \"Bezu Fache,\" the driver said, approaching the pyramid\'s main entrance. \"We call him le Taureau.\" Langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every Frenchman had a mysterious animal epithet.\r\n\"You call your captain the Bull?\"\r\nThe man arched his eyebrows. \"Your French is better than you admit, Monsieur Langdon.\"\r\nMy French stinks, Langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good. Taurus was always the bull. Astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.\r\nThe agent pulled the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a large door in the side of the pyramid. \"There is the entrance. Good luck, monsieur.\"\r\n\"You\'re not coming?\"\r\n\"My orders are to leave you here. I have other business to attend to.\" Langdon heaved a sigh and climbed out. It\'s your circus.\r\nThe agent revved his engine and sped off.\r\nAs Langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized he could easily reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. Something told him it was probably a lousy idea.\r\nAs he moved toward the mist of the fountains, Langdon had the uneasy sense he was crossing an imaginary threshold into another world. The dreamlike quality of the evening was settling around him again. Twenty minutes ago he had been asleep in his hotel room. Now he was standing in front of a transparent pyramid built by the Sphinx, waiting for a policeman they called the Bull.\r\nI\'m trapped in a Salvador Dali painting, he thought.\r\nLangdon strode to the main entrance—an enormous revolving door. The foyer beyond was dimly\r\nlit and deserted.\r\nDo I knock?\r\nLangdon wondered if any of Harvard\'s revered Egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of a pyramid and expected an answer. He raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. The man was stocky and dark, almost Neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. He advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. He was speaking on his cell phone but finished the call as he arrived. He motioned for Langdon to enter.\r\n\r\n\"I am Bezu Fache,\" he announced as Langdon pushed through the revolving door. \"Captain of the Central Directorate Judicial Police.\" His tone was fitting—a guttural rumble... like a gathering storm.\r\nLangdon held out his hand to shake. \"Robert Langdon.\"\r\nFache\'s enormous palm wrapped around Langdon\'s with crushing force.\r\n\"I saw the photo,\" Langdon said. \"Your agent said Jacques Saunière himself did—\"\r\n\"Mr. Langdon,\" Fache\'s ebony eyes locked on. \"What you see in the photo is only the beginning of what Saunière did.\"\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n', NULL),
(7, 2, 1, 'WHEN OUR DRAGON declared war on Indiana, I knew it was going to be a bad day.\r\nWe’d been traveling west for six weeks, and Festus had never shown such hostility toward a state. New Jersey he ignored. Pennsylvania he seemed to enjoy, despite our battle with the Cyclopes of Pittsburgh. Ohio he tolerated, even after our encounter with Potina, the Roman goddess of childhood drinks, who pursued us in the form of a giant red pitcher emblazoned with a smiley face.\r\nYet for some reason, Festus decided he did not like Indiana. He landed on the cupola of the Indiana Statehouse, flapped his metallic wings, and blew a cone of fire that incinerated the state flag right off the flagpole.\r\n“Whoa, buddy!” Leo Valdez pulled the dragon’s reins. “We’ve talked about this. No blowtorching public monuments!”\r\nBehind him on the dragon’s spine, Calypso gripped Festus’s scales for balance. “Could we please get to the ground? Gently this time?”\r\nFor a formerly immortal sorceress who once controlled air spirits, Calypso was not a fan of flying. Cold wind blew her chestnut hair into my face, making me blink and spit.\r\nThat’s right, dear reader.\r\nI, the most important passenger, the youth who had once been the glorious god Apollo, was forced to sit in the back of the dragon. Oh, the indignities I had suffered since Zeus stripped me of my divine powers! It wasn’t enough that I was now a sixteen-year-old mortal with the ghastly alias Lester Papadopoulos. It wasn’t enough that I had to toil upon the earth doing (ugh) heroic quests until I could find a way back into my father’s good graces, or that I had a case of acne which simply would not respond to over-the-counter zit medicine. Despite my\r\nNew York State junior driver’s license, Leo Valdez didn’t trust me to operate his aerial bronze steed!\r\nFestus’s claws scrabbled for a hold on the green copper dome, which was much too small for a dragon his size. I had a flashback to the time I installed a life-size statue of the muse Calliope on my sun chariot and the extra weight of the hood ornament made me nosedive into China and create the Gobi Desert.\r\nLeo glanced back, his face streaked with soot. “Apollo, you sense anything?” “Why is it my job to sense things? Just because I used to be a god of prophecy\r\n—”\r\n“You’re the one who’s been having visions,” Calypso reminded me. “You said\r\nyour friend Meg would be here.”\r\nJust hearing Meg’s name gave me a twinge of pain. “That doesn’t mean I can pinpoint her location with my mind! Zeus has revoked my access to GPS!”\r\n“GPS?” Calypso asked. “Godly positioning systems.” “That’s not a real thing!”\r\n“Guys, cool it.” Leo patted the dragon’s neck. “Apollo, just try, will you?\r\nDoes this look like the city you dreamed about or not?” I scanned the horizon.\r\nIndiana was flat country—highways crisscrossing scrubby brown plains, shadows of winter clouds floating above urban sprawl. Around us rose a meager cluster of downtown high-rises—stacks of stone and glass like layered wedges of black and white licorice. (Not the yummy kind of licorice, either; the nasty variety that sits for eons in your stepmother’s candy bowl on the coffee table. And, no, Hera, why would I be talking about you?)\r\nAfter falling to earth in New York City, I found Indianapolis desolate and uninspiring, as if one proper New York neighborhood—Midtown, perhaps—had been stretched out to encompass the entire area of Manhattan, then relieved of two-thirds of its population and vigorously power-washed.\r\nI could think of no reason why an evil triumvirate of ancient Roman emperors would take interest in such a location. Nor could I imagine why Meg McCaffrey would be sent here to capture me. Yet my visions had been clear. I had seen this skyline. I had heard my old enemy Nero give orders to Meg: Go west. Capture Apollo before he can find the next Oracle. If you cannot bring him to me alive, kill him.\r\nThe truly sad thing about this? Meg was one of my better friends. She also happened to be my demigod master, thanks to Zeus’s twisted sense of humor. As long as I remained mortal, Meg could order me to do anything, even kill myself….No. Better not to think of such possibilities.\r\nI shifted in my metal seat. After so many weeks of travel, I was tired and saddle sore. I wanted to find a safe place to rest. This was not such a city.\r\nSomething about the landscape below made me as restless as Festus.\r\nAlas, I was sure this was where we were meant to be. Despite the danger, if I had a chance of seeing Meg McCaffrey again, of prying her away from her villainous stepfather’s grasp, I had to try.\r\n“This is the spot,” I said. “Before this dome collapses under us, I suggest we get to the ground.”\r\nCalypso grumbled in ancient Minoan, “I already said that.”\r\n“Well, excuse me, sorceress!” I replied in the same language. “Perhaps if you\r\nhad helpful visions, I’d listen to you more often!”\r\nCalypso called me a few names that reminded me how colorful the Minoan language had been before it went extinct.\r\n“Hey, you two,” Leo said. “No ancient dialects. Spanish or English, please.\r\nOr Machine.”\r\nFestus creaked in agreement.\r\n“It’s okay, boy,” Leo said. “I’m sure they didn’t mean to exclude us. Now let’s fly down to street level, huh?”\r\nFestus’s ruby eyes glowed. His metal teeth spun like drill bits. I imagined him thinking, Illinois is sounding pretty good right about now.\r\nBut he flapped his wings and leaped from the dome. We hurtled downward, landing in front of the statehouse with enough force to crack the sidewalk. My eyeballs jiggled like water balloons.\r\nFestus whipped his head from side to side, steam curling from his nostrils. I saw no immediate threats. Cars drove leisurely down West Washington\r\nStreet. Pedestrians strolled by: a middle-aged woman in a flowery dress, a heavyset policeman carrying a paper coffee cup labeled CAFÉ PATACHOU, a clean- cut man in a blue seersucker suit.\r\nThe man in blue waved politely as he passed. “Morning.” “’Sup, dude,” Leo called.\r\nCalypso tilted her head. “Why was he so friendly? Does he not see that we’re sitting atop a fifty-ton metal dragon?”\r\nLeo grinned. “It’s the Mist, babe—messes with mortal eyes. Makes monsters look like stray dogs. Makes swords look like umbrellas. Makes me look even more handsome than usual!”\r\nCalypso jabbed her thumbs into Leo’s kidneys. “Ow!” he complained.\r\n“I know what the Mist is, Leonidas—” “Hey, I told you never to call me that.”\r\n“—but the Mist must be very strong here if it can hide a monster of Festus’s size at such close range. Apollo, don’t you find that a little odd?”\r\nI studied the passing pedestrians.\r\nTrue, I had seen places where the Mist was particularly heavy. At Troy, the sky above the battlefield had been so thick with gods you couldn’t turn your chariot without running into another deity, yet the Trojans and Greeks saw only hints of our presence. At Three Mile Island in 1979, the mortals somehow failed to realize that their partial nuclear meltdown was caused by an epic chainsaw fight between Ares and Hephaestus. (As I recall, Hephaestus had insulted Ares’s bell-bottom jeans.)\r\nStill, I did not think heavy Mist was the problem here. Something about these locals bothered me. Their faces were too placid. Their dazed smiles reminded me of ancient Athenians just before the Dionysus Festival—everyone in a good mood, distracted, thinking about the drunken riots and debauchery to come.\r\n“We should get out of the public eye,” I suggested. “Perhaps—”\r\nFestus stumbled, shaking like a wet dog. From inside his chest came a noise like a loose bicycle chain.\r\n“Aw, not again,” Leo said. “Everybody off!” Calypso and I quickly dismounted.\r\nLeo ran in front of Festus and held out his arms in a classic dragon-wrangler’s stance. “Hey, buddy, it’s fine! I’m just going to switch you off for a while, okay? A little downtime to—”\r\nFestus projectile-vomited a column of flames that engulfed Leo. Fortunately, Valdez was fireproof. His clothes were not. From what Leo had told me, he could generally prevent his outfits from burning up simply by concentrating. If he were caught by surprise, however, it didn’t always work.\r\nWhen the flames dissipated, Leo stood before us wearing nothing but his asbestos boxer shorts, his magical tool belt, and a pair of smoking, partially melted sneakers.\r\n“Dang it!” he complained. “Festus, it’s cold out here!”\r\nThe dragon stumbled. Leo lunged and flipped the lever behind the dragon’s left foreleg. Festus began to collapse. His wings, limbs, neck, and tail contracted into his body, his bronze plates overlapping and folding inward. In a matter of seconds, our robotic friend had been reduced to a large bronze suitcase.\r\nThat should have been physically impossible, of course, but like any decent god, demigod, or engineer, Leo Valdez refused to be stopped by the laws of physics.\r\nHe scowled at his new piece of luggage. “Man…I thought I fixed his gyro- capacitor. Guess we’re stuck here until I can find a machine shop.”\r\nCalypso grimaced. Her pink ski jacket glistened with condensation from our flight through the clouds. “And if we find such a shop, how long will it take to repair Festus?”\r\nLeo shrugged. “Twelve hours? Fifteen?” He pushed a button on the side of the suitcase. A handle popped up. “Also, if we see a men’s clothing store, that might be good.”\r\nI imagined walking into a T.J. Maxx, Leo in boxer shorts and melted sneakers, rolling a bronze suitcase behind him. I did not relish the idea.\r\nThen, from the direction of the sidewalk, a voice called, “Hello!”\r\nThe woman in the flowery dress had returned. At least she looked like the same woman. Either that or lots of ladies in Indianapolis wore purple-and-yellow honeysuckle-pattern dresses and had 1950s bouffant hairstyles.\r\nShe smiled vacantly. “Beautiful morning!”\r\nIt was in fact a miserable morning—cold and cloudy with a smell of impending snow—but I felt it would be rude to ignore her completely.\r\nI gave her a little parade wave—the sort of gesture I used to give my worshippers when they came to grovel at my altar. To me, the message was clear enough: I see you, puny mortal; now run along. The gods are talking.\r\nThe woman did not take the hint. She strolled forward and planted herself in front of us. She wasn’t particularly large, but something about her proportions seemed off. Her shoulders were too wide for her head. Her chest and belly protruded in a lumpy mass, as if she’d stuffed a sack of mangos down the front of her dress. With her spindly arms and legs, she reminded me of some sort of giant beetle. If she ever tipped over, I doubted she could easily get back up.\r\n“Oh, my!” She gripped her purse with both hands. “Aren’t you children cute!”\r\nHer lipstick and eye shadow were both a violent shade of purple. I wondered if she was getting enough oxygen to her brain.\r\n“Madam,” I said, “we are not children.” I could have added that I was over four thousand years old, and Calypso was even older, but I decided not to get into that. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have a suitcase to repair and my friend is in dire need of a pair of pants.”\r\nI tried to step around her. She blocked my path.\r\n“You can’t go yet, dear! We haven’t welcomed you to Indiana!” From her purse, she drew a smartphone. The screen glowed as if a call were already in progress.\r\n“It’s him, all right,” she said into the phone. “Everybody, come on over.\r\nApollo is here!”\r\nMy lungs shriveled in my chest.\r\nIn the old days, I would have expected to be recognized as soon as I arrived in\r\na town. Of course the locals would rush to welcome me. They would sing and dance and throw flowers. They would immediately begin constructing a new temple.\r\nBut as Lester Papadopoulos, I did not warrant such treatment. I looked nothing like my former glorious self. The idea that the Indianans might recognize me despite my tangled hair, acne, and flab was both insulting and terrifying. What if they erected a statue of me in my present form—a giant golden Lester in the center of their city? The other gods would never let me hear the end of it!\r\n“Madam,” I said, “I’m afraid you have mistaken me—”\r\n“Don’t be modest!” The woman tossed her phone and purse aside. She grabbed my forearm with the strength of a weightlifter. “Our master will be delighted to have you in custody. And please call me Nanette.”\r\nCalypso charged. Either she wished to defend me (unlikely), or she was not a fan of the name Nanette. She punched the woman in the face.\r\nThis by itself did not surprise me. Having lost her immortal powers, Calypso was in the process of trying to master other skills. So far, she’d failed at swords, polearms, shurikens, whips, and improvisational comedy. (I sympathized with her frustration.) Today, she’d decided to try fisticuffs.\r\nWhat surprised me was the loud CRACK her fist made against Nanette’s face\r\n—the sound of finger bones breaking.\r\n“Ow!” Calypso stumbled away, clutching her hand.\r\nNanette’s head slid backward. She released me to try to grab her own face, but it was too late. Her head toppled off her shoulders. It clanged against the pavement and rolled sideways, the eyes still blinking, the purple lips twitching. Its base was smooth stainless steel. Attached to it were ragged strips of duct tape stuck with hair and bobby pins.\r\n“Holy Hephaestus!” Leo ran to Calypso’s side. “Lady, you broke my girlfriend’s hand with your face. What are you, an automaton?”\r\n“No, dear,” said decapitated Nanette. Her muffled voice didn’t come from the stainless-steel head on the sidewalk. It emanated from somewhere inside her dress. Just above her collar, where her neck used to be, an outcropping of fine blond hair was tangled with bobby pins. “And I must say, hitting me wasn’t very polite.”\r\nBelatedly, I realized the metal head had been a disguise. Just as satyrs covered their hooves with human shoes, this creature passed for mortal by pretending to have a human face. Its voice came from its gut area, which meant…\r\nMy knees trembled. “A blemmyae,” I said.\r\nNanette chuckled. Her bulging midsection writhed under the honeysuckle\r\ncloth. She ripped open her blouse—something a polite Midwesterner would never think of doing—and revealed her true face.\r\nWhere a woman’s brassiere would have been, two enormous bulging eyes blinked at me. From her sternum protruded a large shiny nose. Across her abdomen curled a hideous mouth—glistening orange lips, teeth like a spread of blank white playing cards.\r\n“Yes, dear,” the face said. “And I’m arresting you in the name of the Triumvirate!”\r\nUp and down Washington Street, pleasant-looking pedestrians turned and began marching in our direction.\r\n', 'Lester (Apollo)\r\nStill human; thanks for asking Gods, I hate my life\r\n');

(8, 2, 2, 'GEE, APOLLO, you may be thinking, why didn’t you simply pull out your bow and shoot her? Or charm her with a song from your combat ukulele? True, I had both those items slung across my back along with my quiver. Sadly, even the best demigod weapons require something called maintenance. My children Kayla and Austin had explained this to me before I left Camp Half-Blood. I couldn’t just pull my bow and quiver out of thin air as I used to when I was a god. I could no longer wish my ukulele into my hands and expect it to be perfectly in tune. My weapons and my musical instrument were carefully wrapped in blankets. Otherwise flying through the wet winter skies would’ve warped the bow, ruined the arrows, and played Hades with the strings of my ukulele. To get them out now would require several minutes that I did not have.Also,I doubted they would do me much good against blemmyae.\r\nI hadn’t dealt with their kind since the time of Julius Caesar, and I would’ve been happy to go another two thousand years without seeing one. How could a god of poetry and music be effective against a species whose ears were wedged under their armpits? Nor did the blemmyae fear or respect archery. They were sturdy melee fighters with thick skin. They were even resistant to most forms of disease, which meant they never called on me for medical help nor feared my plague arrows. Worst of all, they were humorless and unimaginative. They had no interest in the future, so they saw no use for Oracles or prophecies.In short, you could not create a race less sympathetic to an attractive, multitalented god like me. (And believe me, Ares had tried. Those eighteenth- century Hessian mercenaries he cooked up? Ugh. George Washington and I had the\r\nworst time with them.)“Leo,” I said, “activate the dragon.” “I just put him into sleep cycle.” “Hurry!”Leo fumbled with the suitcase’s buttons. Nothing happened. “I told you, man. Even if Festus weren’t malfunctioning, he’s really hard to wake up once he’s asleep.” Wonderful, I thought. Calypso hunched over her broken hand, muttering Minoan obscenities. Leo shivered in his underwear. And I…well, I was Lester. On top of all that, instead of facing our enemies with a large fire-breathing automaton, we would now have to face them with a barely portable piece of metal luggage. I wheeled on the blemmyae. “BEGONE, foul Nanette!” I tried to muster my old godly wrath voice. “Lay hands upon my divine person again and you shall be DESTROYED!”\r\nBack when I was a god, that threat would have been enough to make entire armies wet their camouflage pants. Nanette just blinked her cow-brown eyes. “Don’t fuss, now,” she said. Her lips were grotesquely hypnotic, like watching a surgical incision being used as a puppet. “Besides, dearie, you’re not a god anymore.” Why did people have to keep reminding me of that? More locals converged on our position. Two police officers trotted down the steps of the statehouse. At the corner of Senate Avenue, a trio of sanitation workers abandoned their garbage truck and lumbered over wielding large metal trash cans. From the other direction, a half dozen men in business suits tromped across the capitol lawn. Leo cursed. “Is everybody in this town a metalhead? And I don’t mean the good kind of metalhead.” “Relax, sweetie,” Nanette said. “Surrender and we won’t have to hurt you much. That’s the emperor’s job!” Despite her broken hand, Calypso apparently didn’t feel like surrendering. With a defiant yell she charged Nanette again, this time launching a karate kick toward the blemmyae’s giant nose. “Don’t!” I blurted out, too late.\r\nAs I mentioned, blemmyae are sturdy beings. They’re difficult to hurt and even more difficult to kill. Calypso’s foot connected with its target, and her ankle bent with a nasty pop. She collapsed, gurgling in pain.\r\n“Cal!” Leo ran to her side. “Back off, chest-face!” “Language, dear,” Nanette chided. “Now I’m afraid I’ll have to stomp on you.”She raised one patent leather pump, but Leo was faster. He summoned a globe of fire and threw it like a baseball, hitting Nanette right between her huge chest- level eyes. Flames washed over her, setting her eyebrows and flowery dress ablaze. As Nanette screamed and stumbled, Leo yelled, “Apollo, help me!” I realized I’d been standing there, frozen in shock—which would’ve been fine if I’d been watching the scene unfold from the safety of my throne on Mount Olympus. Alas, I was very much down here in the trenches with the lesser beings. I helped get Calypso to her feet (her one good foot, at least). We slung her arms over our shoulders (with lots of screaming from Calypso when I accidentally grabbed her broken hand) and began hobbling away.\r\nThirty feet across the lawn, Leo suddenly stopped. “I forgot Festus!” “Leave him,” I snapped.“What?”“We can’t manage him and Calypso! We’ll come back later. The blemmyae might just ignore him.”“But if they figure out how to open him,” Leo fretted, “if they hurt him—” “MARRRGGGGH!” Behind us, Nanette ripped off the shreds of her burning dress. From the waist down, shaggy blond fur covered her body, not unlike a satyr. Her eyebrows smoldered, but otherwise her face looked unhurt. She spat ashes from her mouth and glared in our direction. “That was not nice! GET THEM!” The businessmen were almost on top of us, eliminating any hope that we could make it back to Festus without getting caught. We chose the only heroic option available: we ran. I hadn’t felt so encumbered since my three-legged death race with Meg McCaffrey back at Camp Half-Blood. Calypso tried to help, kicking along like a pogo stick between Leo and me, but whenever she jostled her broken foot or hand, she yelped and sagged against us. “S-sorry, guys,” she muttered, her face beaded with sweat. “Guess I’m not meant to be a melee fighter.” “Neither am I,” I admitted. “Perhaps Leo can hold them off while—”“Hey, don’t look at me,” Leo grumbled. “I’m just a repair guy who can throw the occasional fireball. Our fighter is stuck back there in suitcase mode.”“Hobble faster,” I suggested.\r\nWe reached the street alive only because the blemmyae moved so slowly. I suppose I would, too, if I were balancing a fake metal head on my, er, head, but even without their disguises, the blemmyae were not as swift as they were strong. Their terrible depth perception made them walk with exaggerated caution, as if the ground were a multilayered hologram. If only we could out-hobble them… “Good morning!” A police officer appeared on our right, his firearm drawn. “Halt or I will shoot! Thank you!”\r\nLeo pulled a stoppered glass bottle from his tool belt. He tossed it at the officer’s feet and green flames exploded around him. The officer dropped his gun. He began tearing off his burning uniform, revealing a chest-face with shaggy pectoral eyebrows and a belly beard in need of a shave. “Phew,” Leo said. “I was hoping he was a blemmyae. That was my only vial of Greek fire, guys. And I can’t keep summoning fireballs unless I want to pass out, so—” “We need to find cover,” said Calypso.Sensible advice, but cover did not seem to be an Indiana concept. The streets were wide and straight, the landscape flat, the crowds sparse, the sight lines endless.We turned onto South Capitol. I glanced over my shoulder and saw the mob of smiling fake-headed locals gaining on us. A construction worker stopped to rip the fender off a Ford pickup, then rejoined the parade, his new chrome club slung over his shoulder. Meanwhile, the regular mortals—at least, those who did not seem interested in killing us at the moment—went about their business, making phone calls, waiting at traffic lights, sipping coffee in nearby cafés, completely ignoring us. At one corner, sitting on a milk crate, a heavily blanketed homeless man asked me for change. I resisted the urge to tell him that change was coming up fast behind us, carrying assorted weapons.My heart pounded. My legs shook. I hated having a mortal body. I experienced so many bothersome things, like fear, cold, nausea, and the impulse to whimper Please don’t kill me! If only Calypso hadn’t broken her ankle we might have moved faster, but we couldn’t very well leave her behind. Not that I particularly liked Calypso, mind you, but I’d already convinced Leo to abandon his dragon. I didn’t want to push my luck. “There!” said the sorceress. She pointed with her chin to what looked like a service alley behind a hotel.I shuddered, remembering my first day in New York as Lester Papadopoulos. “What if it’s a dead end? The last time I found myself in a dead-end alley, things did not go well.”“Let’s try,” Leo said. “We might be able to hide in there, or…I dunno.”I dunno sounded like a sketchy plan B, but I had nothing better to offer.Good news: the alley was not a dead end. I could clearly see an exit at the far end of the block. Bad news: the loading bays along the back of the hotel were locked, giving us nowhere to hide, and the opposite wall of the alley was lined with Dumpsters. Oh, Dumpsters! How I hated them! Leo sighed. “I guess we could jump in—” “No!” I snapped. “Never again!” We struggled through the alley as fast as we could. I tried to calm my nerves by silently composing a sonnet about various ways a wrathful god could destroy Dumpsters. I became so engrossed I didn’t notice what was in front of us until Calypso gasped. Leo halted. “What the—? Hijo.” The apparition glowed with a faint ginger light. He wore a traditional chiton, sandals, and a sheathed sword, like a Greek warrior in the prime of life…except for the fact that he had been decapitated. Unlike the blemmyae, however, this person obviously had once been human. Ethereal blood trickled from his severed neck, splattering his luminous orange tunic.\r\n“It’s a cheese-colored ghost,” Leo said.\r\nThe spirit raised one hand, beckoning us forward. Not being born a mortal, I had no particular fear of the dead. You’ve seen one tormented soul, you’ve seen them all. But something about this ghost unsettled me. He stirred a distant memory, a feeling of guilt from thousands of years ago…. Behind us, the voices of the blemmyae grew louder. I heard them calling out “Morning!” and “Excuse me!” and “Lovely day!” to their fellow Indianans.\r\n“What do we do?” Calypso asked. “Follow the ghost,” I said. “What?” Leo yelped.“We follow the cheese-colored ghost. As you’re always saying: Vaya con queso.”“That was a joke, ese.”The orange spirit beckoned again, then floated toward the end of the alley. Behind us, a man’s voice shouted, “There you are! Lovely weather, isn’t it?” I turned in time to see a truck fender spiraling toward us.“Down!” I tackled Calypso and Leo, provoking more screams of agony from the sorceress. The truck fender sailed over our heads and slammed into a Dumpster, sending up a festive explosion of garbage confetti.\r\nWe struggled to our feet. Calypso was shivering, no longer complaining about the pain. I was fairly sure she was going into shock.Leo pulled a staple gun from his tool belt. “You guys go ahead. I’ll hold them off as long as I can.”“What are you going to do?” I demanded. “Sort and collate them?”\r\n“I’m going to throw things at them!” Leo snapped. “Unless you’ve got a better\r\nidea?”“B-both of you stop,” Calypso stammered. “We d-don’t leave anyone behind.\r\nNow walk. Left, right, left, right.”We emerged from the alley into a wide-open circular plaza. Oh, why couldn’t Indianans build a proper city with narrow, twisting streets, plenty of dark corners, and perhaps some conveniently placed bombproof bunkers?\r\nIn the middle of a ring-shaped drive stood a fountain surrounded by dormant flower beds. To the north rose the twin towers of another hotel. To the south loomed an older, grander building of redbrick and granite—perhaps a Victorian- era train station. On one side of the edifice, a clock tower soared roughly two hundred feet into the sky. Above the main entrance, under a marble archway, a colossal rose window gleamed in a frame of green copper, like a stained-glass version of the dartboard we used for our weekly game night on Mount Olympus.That thought made me heartsick with nostalgia. I would’ve given anything to be back home for game night, even if it meant listening to Athena gloat about her Scrabble scores.I scanned the plaza. Our ghostly guide seemed to have disappeared. Why had he brought us here? Should we try the hotel? The train station? Those questions became moot when the blemmyae surrounded us.The mob burst out of the alley behind us. A police car swerved into the roundabout next to the train station. A bulldozer pulled into the hotel’s driveway, the operator waving and calling out cheerfully, “Hello! I’m going to bulldoze you!”All exits from the plaza were quickly blocked.A line of sweat freeze-dried against my neck. An annoying whine filled my ears, which I realized was my own subvocalized whimpering of Please don’t kill me, please don’t kill me.I won’t die here, I promised myself. I’m much too important to bite it in Indiana.But my trembling legs and chattering teeth seemed to disagree.\r\n“Who has an idea?” I asked my compatriots. “Please, any brilliant idea.”Calypso looked like her most brilliant idea at the moment was trying not to throw up. Leo hefted his staple gun, which didn’t seem to frighten the blemmyae.From the midst of the mob, our old friend Nanette emerged, her chest-face grinning. Her patent leather pumps clashed terribly with her blond leg fur. “Gosh darn it, dears, you’ve made me a bit miffed.”\r\nShe grabbed the nearest street sign and single-handedly ripped it out of the ground. “Now, please hold still, won’t you? I’m just going to smash your heads with this.', 'Headless guys and gals\r\nNot loving the Midwest vibe Oh, look—a cheese ghost\r\n'),
